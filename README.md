<h4 align="right">Africa-Adult literacy rate-Butterfly chart</h4>

## Intro :
A Butterfly chart (also called as Tornado chart) is a type of bar chart where two sets of data series are displayed side by side. It gives a quick glance of the difference between two groups with same parameters. It is also possible to stack/place two bars on each side (for example, ‚Äòmale‚Äô and ‚Äòfemale‚Äô) to give a further division of adult literacy rate by country name. The main use of the butterfly chart is comparison of two data sets sharing the same parameters.
